                <p>The object for our Scratch project was to create either a story or a game with my partner, Josh Koh, that demonstrates our knowledge of programming fundamentals and our ability to use the Scratch interface. In the beginning, Josh and I concluded that we wanted to create a story with user inputs— like a “Choose Your Own Adventure” type. In our Scratch story code, we also displayed our creativity with not only the story outline but with the effect we added to the buttons the user clicks on to input their choice in between scenes. Our button increases in size when the mouse cursor hovers above it. Additionally our project intakes the username so that our characters in our story can make humorous remarks at the user. A challenge we were forced to overcome was the time constraint of the project. Initially, we planned for many different paths the main character could take, but as the due date of the project came closer, we realized that we would need to somehow combine all our ideas in a condensed scene. In the end, we did manage to include all of our ideas that we had planned to include although our story could definitely have been better given more time. I hope that in future projects, our class would have more sufficient amount of time for us to include all of our creativity. During the project, Josh and I shared every work done which included the programming portion, the background image creation, and the Project Notebook where stored all of our information professionally. Our Project Notebook includes our brainstorming, the daily log of what Josh and I did, and the feedback we gained from the gallery walk we did in class. Since the Project Notebook was required, I felt at first it was some extra work. However at the end of the project, the organization felt amazing to look over and now I plan to create my own Project Notebook whenever I do a project in my free time.</p>
